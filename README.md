# Number_Recognisation_ML

📊 About the MNIST Dataset: This dataset contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), split into a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. Each image is 28x28 pixels.

🔧 Key Highlights:

Loaded and preprocessed the dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.
Built a Neural Network with layers for flattening, dense units, dropout, and a final dense layer for classification.
Trained the model with an accuracy of 97.7% on the test set!
Used Softmax to convert output to a probability distribution over classes.
Successfully recognized handwritten digits. 🖐️✍️
💡 Takeaways: This project showcases the power of neural networks in recognizing handwritten digits, a fundamental task in computer vision. It's a great stepping stone for more complex image recognition tasks. #MachineLearning #NeuralNetworks #ComputerVision #MNIST
